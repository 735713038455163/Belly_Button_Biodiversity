During the 12th week of the Trilogy University of Toronto Data Analytics & Visualization Bootcamp our Module 12 challenge is to create a written analysis with four key deliverables as follows; 

Here is the list of deliverables for the analysis of 4 deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart

Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard

We will be using:

- VS Code:  text editor to create and edit HTML and JavaScript files.
- Web Browser:  a web browser, such as Chrome, to view, inspect, and debug your visualizations. 
- Command-line interface: You will use the command-line interface to run a local server.  Git Bash.
- GitHub: To deploy your final data visualization on GitHub 

Specifically, the files are found in the js folder:

index.html 
plots.js
samples.json
