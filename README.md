#Overview of Project



During the 12th week of the Trilogy University of Toronto Data Analytics & Visualization Bootcamp our Module 12 challenge is to create a written analysis with four key deliverables as follows; 

Here is the list of deliverables for the analysis of 4 deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard

Specifically,

Creating engaging and dynamic charts using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js

The files we will be using are:

- VS Code: You will use a text editor to create and edit HTML and JavaScript files.
- Web Browser: You will use a web browser, such as Chrome, to view, inspect, and debug your visualizations. We will use Chrome in our examples.
- Command-line interface: You will use the command-line interface to run a local server. If you're a Mac user, this means Terminal. If you're a Windows user, you'll be using Git Bash.
- GitHub: As you will deploy your final data visualization on GitHub Pages, you will need your GitHub account.
